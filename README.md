**Data Cleaning**  <br>
Handling missing values  <br>
Correcting data types  <br>
Removing duplicates  <br>
Normalizing data <br>

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  <br>
EDA is conducted to understand the underlying patterns and insights in the data.  <br>
Description Analysis  <br>
Data visualization  <br>
Identifying trends and outliers.  <br>

**SQL Querying**  <br>
For more complex queries and to derive deeper insights, SQL is used. The SQL scripts can be found in the Amazon_Insights.sql  <br>
**Dashboard Reporting**
The final step is to create an interactive dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard provides a visual representation of the key insights derived from the analysis. <br>
